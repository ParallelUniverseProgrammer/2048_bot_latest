## 🧪 Test Suite & Developer Experience

The `tests/` directory is now fully reorganized for clarity, speed, and maintainability. Tests are grouped by category, with clear naming conventions and subfolders for each type of test. Most integration tests will automatically start a mock backend if the real backend is not running, making it easy to run tests in isolation.

### Directory Structure

```
tests/
├── core/          # Core/unit tests (no backend required)
├── integration/   # Backend API/integration tests (mock backend auto-started if needed)
├── performance/   # Performance and optimization tests
├── mobile/        # Mobile/device compatibility tests
├── playback/      # Game playback and simulation tests
├── training/      # Training-related tests
├── frontend/      # Frontend integration/UI tests
├── utilities/     # Test utilities and mock services
├── runners/       # Test runners and orchestration scripts
├── checkpoints/   # Test checkpoint data
├── README.md
└── ..._test_results.json
```

### Running Tests

- **Core/unit tests:**
  ```bash
  python tests/core/test_checkpoint_loading.py
  ```
- **Integration/API tests:**
  ```bash
  python tests/integration/test_complete_games.py
  # Most will auto-start a mock backend if needed
  ```
- **Performance tests:**
  ```bash
  python tests/performance/test_performance.py
  ```
- **Mobile/device tests:**
  ```bash
  python tests/mobile/test_connection_issues.py
  ```
- **Playback tests:**
  ```bash
  python tests/playback/test_freeze_detection.py
  ```
- **Training tests:**
  ```bash
  python tests/training/test_status_sync.py
  ```
- **Frontend tests:**
  ```bash
  python tests/frontend/test_automation.py
  ```
- **All tests (comprehensive):**
  ```bash
  python tests/runners/master_test_runner.py --level comprehensive
  ```

### Backend Dependency Handling
- **Mock backend auto-start:** Most integration tests use a utility to start a mock backend if the real one is not running. No manual backend launch is needed for these tests.
- **Real backend required:** Some advanced or real-system tests may require the backend running manually. This will be clearly documented in the test or runner script.

### Best Practices for Contributing Tests
- Place new tests in the correct subfolder by category
- Use the shared utilities in `tests/utilities/test_utils.py` for logging, backend helpers, etc.
- Prefer descriptive, consistent file names (e.g., `test_feature_behavior.py`)
- Document backend dependencies in the test docstring
- Add edge cases and error handling scenarios
- Update this README and `tests/README.md` if you add new categories or major tests

### Example: Adding a New Test
1. Place your script in the appropriate folder (e.g., `tests/playback/test_new_playback_feature.py`)
2. Use imports like:
   ```python
   from tests.utilities.test_utils import TestLogger, BackendTester
   ```
3. Run your test directly:
   ```bash
   python tests/playback/test_new_playback_feature.py
   ```

For more details, see `tests/README.md` and `tests/organization_plan.md`.

## 🕹️ Usage Guide

### Starting a Training Session
1.  **Access the UI**: Open your browser to the URL provided by your setup method (typically `http://localhost:3000`).
2.  **Connect**: The frontend will automatically establish a WebSocket connection to the backend. The connection status is displayed in the header.
3.  **Initiate Training**: Click the **Start** button. This initializes the model with a dynamically selected configuration based on your hardware and begins the training process.
4.  **Monitor**: Real-time metrics, game states, and network visualizations will immediately begin streaming to the dashboard.

### Navigating the Interface
The application is organized into four main tabs:
- **📊 Training**: The main dashboard. View real-time charts for loss, score, action distributions, and expert usage. Key performance indicators (KPIs) like training speed and GPU memory are also displayed here.
- **🎮 Game**: Watch the AI play the game in real-time. This view includes the game board, the AI's chosen action, and an optional attention overlay to see what the model is "focusing" on.
- **🧠 Network**: A visual deep-dive into the transformer architecture. See the model's layers, inspect expert routing patterns, and analyze the load-balancing score.
- **💾 Checkpoints**: Manage, review, and test saved model checkpoints.

### Checkpoint Playback
From the **Checkpoints** tab, you can load a previously saved model for analysis.
- **Load a Checkpoint**: Select a checkpoint from the list.
- **Start Playback**: Click the "Play" icon to initiate a game simulation using the selected model's weights.
- **Analyze**: Navigate to the **Game** tab to watch the checkpoint play. You can control the playback speed, pause, and stop the simulation.

  }
}
```

## 🏛️ System Architecture

The project is a decoupled, two-part system: a Python backend and a React frontend.

- **Backend**: A FastAPI server manages the entire training pipeline. It uses PyTorch for the neural network, Gymnasium for the game environment, and a custom PPO trainer. A `TrainingManager` runs the main loop in a separate thread, allowing for non-blocking control via REST and WebSocket endpoints. All operations are designed to be thread-safe.

- **Frontend**: A responsive React application built with Vite and TypeScript. It uses Zustand for efficient state management, Chart.js for visualizations, and Framer Motion for smooth animations. A sophisticated `WebSocket` utility handles real-time data streaming with adaptive timeouts, exponential backoff, circuit breaker patterns, and polling fallback to ensure a stable experience, especially on mobile networks. Enhanced loading states provide comprehensive progress tracking with step-by-step feedback and estimated completion times.

## 🤖 Neural Network Deep Dive

The core of this project is a purpose-built Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Transformer. This architecture was chosen over a standard transformer for its ability to develop specialized sub-networks (experts) that can handle distinct patterns and phases of the 2048 game, leading to more nuanced and effective decision-making.

Here's a breakdown of how the network processes the game state.

### 1. Input Processing: From Board to Language

The model doesn't "see" the board as pixels; it interprets it as a sequence of tokens, much like words in a sentence.

-   **Tokenization**: The 4x4 grid is flattened into a 16-token sequence. Each tile's value (e.g., 2, 4, 8, 1024) is transformed by taking its `log2` (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 10). This normalizes the values and creates a linear relationship that's easier for the network to learn. Empty tiles are represented by a zero token.
-   **2D Positional Encoding**: A standard transformer only knows the order of tokens, not their spatial relationship. For a grid game like 2048, knowing that one tile is "above" or "to the left of" another is critical. We inject this knowledge using a custom **2D positional encoding**, which encodes both row and column information for each of the 16 positions. This gives the model a native understanding of the board's geometry.

### 2. The Core: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Transformer

This is where the model's intelligence lies. Instead of a single, monolithic network processing every game state, the MoE architecture uses a collection of smaller, specialized networks.

-   **The Router**: At the heart of each MoE layer is a small "gating" network, or router. When a board state (represented as 16 tokens) arrives, the router analyzes it and decides which of the available "experts" are best suited to handle it. It's a "soft" decision—it assigns probabilities and routes the information to a small subset (e.g., the top 2) of the most relevant experts.

-   **The Experts**: Each expert is a standard feed-forward neural network. While they all start with the same architecture, training causes them to specialize. For example:
    -   *Expert 1* might become adept at identifying immediate merge opportunities in the early game.
    -   *Expert 4* could specialize in the complex patterns required to maintain an open board in the late game.
    -   *Expert 7* might learn to recognize defensive positions for survival when the board is cluttered.
    You can see this specialization emerge in real-time in the **Network Visualizer**.

-   **Load Balancing**: A key challenge with MoE is preventing the router from over-relying on a few "superstar" experts. To combat this, the training process includes an auxiliary **load-balancing loss**. This loss function penalizes the model if it doesn't spread the workload evenly, encouraging it to utilize all experts and fostering greater specialization.

### 3. Self-Attention: Discovering Relationships

Within each transformer block, the self-attention mechanism allows the model to weigh the importance of every tile relative to every other tile.

For each of the 16 positions, attention calculates a set of scores that determine how much "focus" to place on the other 15 positions. For example, a `512` tile in the corner might learn to pay high attention to an adjacent `512` tile (a merge opportunity) and to nearby empty cells (potential escape routes). This is the data visualized in the **Attention Heatmaps** tab, providing a direct look into the model's reasoning process.

### 4. Output Heads: The Final Decision

After the board state has been processed through multiple layers of attention and MoE blocks, the resulting high-level representation is passed to two final, separate networks:

1.  **Policy Head**: This head outputs a probability distribution over the four possible moves (Up, Down, Left, Right). It represents the model's final decision on which move is most likely to lead to a better outcome.
2.  **Value Head**: This head outputs a single scalar number, which is the model's assessment of the current board's quality. A high value signifies a strong, promising position, while a low value indicates a weak or dangerous one. This value is critical for the PPO algorithm to learn and improve its policy over time.
