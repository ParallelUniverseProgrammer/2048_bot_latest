## Technology Stack

| Layer | Tech |
|-------|------|
| Backend | **Python 3.9 / FastAPI / PyTorch** |
| RL | Custom PPO with MoE Transformer |
| Frontend | **React + TypeScript / Vite / Tailwind CSS / Framer Motion** |
| State Mgmt | Zustand (with persistence & WebSocket hydration) |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone & enter the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/krdge/2048_bot_latest.git && cd 2048_bot_latest

# Fire up everything via the launcher (backend, frontend & tunnel/QR)
$ python launcher.py

# Or launch with desktop GUI window
$ python launcher.py --gui

# Open http://localhost:8000  (QR code displayed prominently in terminal)
```

The launcher installs dependencies, detects hardware (CUDA ‚ÜîÔ∏é CPU) and starts both servers with automatic Cloudflare Tunnel creation for internet access. The new console interface features smooth progress animations and prominently displays the QR code for mobile access.

### Advanced Usage

The launcher supports multiple deployment modes:

```bash
# Development mode (LAN only, hot reload)
python launcher.py --dev

# Desktop GUI mode with system tray
python launcher.py --gui

# LAN access only (no tunnel, faster startup)
python launcher.py --lan-only

# Tunnel access only (cloud-first deployment)
python launcher.py --tunnel-only

# Production mode (named tunnel, optimized build)
python launcher.py --production

# Custom configuration
python launcher.py --port 9000 --tunnel-type named --no-qr
```

See [LAUNCHER_README.md](./LAUNCHER_README.md) for complete usage instructions and all available options.

## Test Suite & Developer Experience

‚úÖ **Test Suite Compliance Overhaul Complete** ‚Äì All major compliance issues have been resolved with comprehensive TestLogger integration across the entire test suite.

‚úÖ **Backend Decorator Implementation Complete** ‚Äì Comprehensive backend management system with automatic decorator application and validation.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: The backend parity test (`tests/integration/test_backend_parity.py`) is a comprehensive test that validates API consistency between real and mock backends. It takes 10-15 minutes to run and should only be used for thorough validation, not regular testing.

The test suite now features:
‚Ä¢ **Standardized Logging** ‚Äì Consistent TestLogger usage across all 68 test files
‚Ä¢ **Zero Major Issues** ‚Äì All compliance violations resolved (down from 66 major issues to just 3)
‚Ä¢ **Automated Backend Management** ‚Äì `@requires_real_backend` and `@requires_mock_backend` decorators automatically handle backend startup/teardown
‚Ä¢ **Improved Maintainability** ‚Äì Proper main() functions with return values and exit codes
‚Ä¢ **Enhanced Error Handling** ‚Äì Standardized error reporting and debugging capabilities
‚Ä¢ **Comprehensive Coverage** ‚Äì Tests grouped by domain (core, integration, performance, mobile, frontend)
‚Ä¢ **Compliance Checker** ‚Äì Automated tool to ensure all test files follow standards
‚Ä¢ **Backend Decorator Utilities** ‚Äì Automated scripts for decorator application, legacy cleanup, and validation

### Running Tests

**Master Test Runner** (Recommended):
```bash
python tests/runners/master_test_runner.py --level core
```

**Individual Test Categories**:
```bash
# Core functionality tests
python tests/core/test_checkpoint_loading.py

# Integration tests
python tests/integration/test_complete_games.py

# Backend parity test (comprehensive - takes 10-15 minutes)
python tests/integration/test_backend_parity.py

# Frontend tests
python tests/frontend/test_automation.py

# Performance tests
python tests/performance/test_performance.py
```

**Compliance Checker**:
```bash
python tests/compliance_checker.py
```

### Pre-Commit Checklist

**Before committing any test changes, always run:**

1. **Compliance Checker** - Ensure your test files follow standards:
   ```bash
   python tests/compliance_checker.py
   ```

2. **Master Test Runner** - Verify your changes work correctly:
   ```bash
   python tests/runners/master_test_runner.py --level core
   ```

This ensures all test files maintain consistency and functionality before being committed to the repository.

### Test Architecture

The test suite follows a structured approach with:
‚Ä¢ **TestLogger** ‚Äì Standardized logging with colors, formatting, and structured output
‚Ä¢ **BackendTester** ‚Äì Common backend API testing functionality
‚Ä¢ **GameTester** ‚Äì Game playback testing utilities
‚Ä¢ **PlaybackTester** ‚Äì Live playback and control testing

All tests use consistent message prefixes (OK:, ERROR:, WARNING:, INFO:) for easy parsing and visual scanning.

### Backend Parity Testing

The backend parity test (`tests/integration/test_backend_parity.py`) is a comprehensive validation tool that ensures the mock backend accurately reflects the real backend's API behavior. It tests:

‚Ä¢ **API Endpoint Consistency** ‚Äì All endpoints available on both backends
‚Ä¢ **Response Format Matching** ‚Äì Identical JSON structure and data types
‚Ä¢ **Error Handling Parity** ‚Äì Same error responses and status codes
‚Ä¢ **WebSocket Functionality** ‚Äì WebSocket connections and message handling
‚Ä¢ **Performance Characteristics** ‚Äì Response time comparisons within acceptable ranges

**TODO: Backend Parity Cleanup**
- The parity test currently identifies several API inconsistencies between real and mock backends
- These need to be addressed to ensure test reliability and accurate mock backend behavior
- Priority: Fix response format mismatches, missing endpoints, and error handling differences
- Run `python tests/integration/test_backend_parity.py` to see current parity status

### Developer Experience

Hot-reload is enabled out of the box (FastAPI `--reload`, Vite dev server). ESLint / Prettier (frontend) and Black / isort / flake8 (backend) keep the codebase tidy.

See [tests/README.md](./tests/README.md) for comprehensive testing documentation and guidelines.

## API

### REST Endpoints (selection)
| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `POST` | `/api/training/start` | Begin training |
| `POST` | `/api/training/stop` | Stop training |
| `POST` | `/api/training/pause` | Pause training |
| `GET`  | `/api/training/status` | Current status |
| `GET`  | `/api/checkpoints` | List checkpoints |
| `POST` | `/api/checkpoints/{id}/load` | Resume training from checkpoint |
| `POST` | `/checkpoints/{id}/playback/start` | Start playback |

### WebSocket Channels
* `training_update` ‚Äì metrics every 1-2 s
* `game_state` ‚Äì board + attention weights during training/playback

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| **WebSocket disconnects on mobile Safari** | iOS limitations | Fallback polling activates automatically; try Chrome or ensure same Wi-Fi LAN |
| **CUDA out-of-memory** | Model too large | The backend auto-switches to CPU; lower model size via dropdown before starting training |
| **Port already in use** | Previous run crashed | kill -9 $(lsof -ti:3000,8000) (or use Task Manager on Windows) |
| **GUI launcher not working** | Missing dependencies | Run `pip install customtkinter pillow` to install GUI dependencies |

More in `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` (coming soon).

## FAQ

**Q:** *Do I need a GPU?*  
**A:** No. Training is slower but fully functional on CPU.

**Q:** *How long until the bot reaches 2048?*  
**A:** ~1‚Äì2 h on RTX 3070 for the large model, *significantly* longer on CPU.

**Q:** *Can I export checkpoints?*  
**A:** Yes ‚Äì checkpoints are standard PyTorch `.pt` files saved under `backend/checkpoints/`.

**Q:** *How does the mobile experience work?*  
**A:** The interface is fully responsive and touch-optimized. Double-tap charts to expand them, and all controls are designed for mobile interaction.

**Q:** *What's the difference between console and GUI launcher?*  
**A:** Console launcher provides ultra-smooth animations and QR-focused display. GUI launcher offers a desktop window with system tray integration, one-click URL copying, and service management controls.
