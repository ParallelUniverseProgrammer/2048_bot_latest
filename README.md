## Technology Stack

| Layer | Tech |
|-------|------|
| Backend | **Python 3.9 / FastAPI / PyTorch** |
| RL | Custom PPO with MoE Transformer |
| Frontend | **React + TypeScript / Vite / Tailwind CSS / Framer Motion** |
| State Mgmt | Zustand (with persistence & WebSocket hydration) |
| Charts | Chart.js (mobile-optimised) |
| Testing | pytest, Jest & custom runners |
| Packaging | Poetry (Python) / npm (Node) |

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone & enter the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/krdge/2048_bot_latest.git && cd 2048_bot_latest

# Fire up everything via the launcher (backend, frontend & tunnel/QR)
$ python launcher.py

# Open http://localhost:8000  (QR code printed for mobile)
```

The launcher installs dependencies, detects hardware (CUDA â†”ï¸Ž CPU) and starts both servers with automatic Cloudflare Tunnel creation for internet access.

### Advanced Usage

The launcher supports multiple deployment modes:

```bash
# Development mode (LAN only, hot reload)
python launcher.py --dev

# LAN access only (no tunnel, faster startup)
python launcher.py --lan-only

# Tunnel access only (cloud-first deployment)
python launcher.py --tunnel-only

# Production mode (named tunnel, optimized build)
python launcher.py --production

# Custom configuration
python launcher.py --port 9000 --tunnel-type named --no-qr
```

See [LAUNCHER_README.md](./LAUNCHER_README.md) for complete usage instructions and all available options.

## Usage Guide

### Navigation
The interface is split into three tabs:

| Tab | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **Training** | Redesigned real-time metrics, compact charts and smart training controls. Features context-aware buttons that adapt based on training state. |
| **Game** | Live board view for training or checkpoint playback with attention overlay and playback controls. |
| **Checkpoints** | Library of saved models with rename, search, resume-training and playback. |

### Starting a Training Session
1. Launch the backend & frontend (see *Quick Start*).
2. Navigate to **Training** and press **Start Training**. Select model size if prompted.
3. Monitor metrics or switch to **Game** to visually inspect gameplay.
4. Use the smart controls to pause, resume, or create manual checkpoints as needed.

### Mobile Experience
â€¢ **Touch-Optimized**: All controls are designed for touch interaction
â€¢ **Chart Expansion**: Double-tap any chart to view it in full-screen mode
â€¢ **Responsive Layout**: Automatically adapts to your device's screen size
â€¢ **PWA Installation**: Install directly to your home screen for offline access

### Remote Access
The launcher automatically creates a Cloudflare Tunnel for internet access:
- **Quick Tunnel**: Temporary HTTPS URL (no account required)
- **Named Tunnel**: Persistent HTTPS URL (requires Cloudflare account setup)
- **Mobile PWA**: Install directly from tunnel URL for offline access
- **QR Code**: Scan to access from any mobile device

### Playing a Checkpoint
1. Open **Checkpoints** and click *Watch* on any entry.
2. You'll be auto-redirected to **Game** while the playback environment starts (progress bar at top).
3. Pause/resume, change speed or start a new game anytime.

## Test Suite & Developer Experience

Tests live under `tests/` and are grouped by domain (core, integration, performance, mobile, frontendâ€¦). Most integration tests spin up a mock backend automatically.

Run all tests:
```bash
python tests/runners/master_test_runner.py
```

Hot-reload is enabled out of the box (FastAPI `--reload`, Vite dev server). ESLint / Prettier (frontend) and Black / isort / flake8 (backend) keep the codebase tidy.

---

## API

### REST Endpoints (selection)
| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `POST` | `/api/training/start` | Begin training |
| `POST` | `/api/training/stop` | Stop training |
| `POST` | `/api/training/pause` | Pause training |
| `GET`  | `/api/training/status` | Current status |
| `GET`  | `/api/checkpoints` | List checkpoints |
| `POST` | `/api/checkpoints/{id}/load` | Resume training from checkpoint |
| `POST` | `/checkpoints/{id}/playback/start` | Start playback |

### WebSocket Channels
* `training_update` â€“ metrics every 1-2 s
* `game_state` â€“ board + attention weights during training/playback

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| **WebSocket disconnects on mobile Safari** | iOS limitations | Fallback polling activates automatically; try Chrome or ensure same Wi-Fi LAN |
| **CUDA out-of-memory** | Model too large | The backend auto-switches to CPU; lower model size via dropdown before starting training |
| **Port already in use** | Previous run crashed | kill -9 $(lsof -ti:3000,8000) (or use Task Manager on Windows) |

More in `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` (coming soon).

## FAQ

**Q:** *Do I need a GPU?*  
**A:** No. Training is slower but fully functional on CPU.

**Q:** *How long until the bot reaches 2048?*  
**A:** ~1â€“2 h on RTX 3070 for the large model, *significantly* longer on CPU.

**Q:** *Can I export checkpoints?*  
**A:** Yes â€“ checkpoints are standard PyTorch `.pt` files saved under `backend/checkpoints/`.

**Q:** *How does the mobile experience work?*  
**A:** The interface is fully responsive and touch-optimized. Double-tap charts to expand them, and all controls are designed for mobile interaction.

## ðŸš€ Development Roadmap

### UI/UX Improvements âœ… COMPLETED
We've successfully redesigned the Training Dashboard with a focus on mobile-first design and user experience:

â€¢ **Smart Controls** â€“ Context-aware buttons that adapt based on training state
â€¢ **Compact Layout** â€“ Optimized spacing and chart sizes that fit perfectly on mobile screens
â€¢ **Touch Optimization** â€“ Double-tap chart expansion and touch-friendly controls
â€¢ **Responsive Design** â€“ Seamless experience across all device sizes
â€¢ **Visual Polish** â€“ Streamlined interface that reduces cognitive load while maintaining all functionality

### Remote Access Integration âœ… COMPLETED
We've successfully implemented **Cloudflare Tunnel integration** to transform this LAN-only development tool into an internet-reachable, HTTPS-secured service. This enables:

â€¢ **Internet Accessibility** â€“ Access from anywhere via HTTPS with automatic QR code generation
â€¢ **Zero Configuration** â€“ Automatic tunnel setup with Quick Tunnel fallback
â€¢ **Production Ready** â€“ Named tunnels with auto-reconnect, monitoring, and service persistence
â€¢ **Mobile PWA Support** â€“ Seamless installation and offline functionality across all devices

The launcher now supports multiple deployment modes including development, production, and cloud-first configurations. See [LAUNCHER_README.md](./LAUNCHER_README.md) for complete usage instructions.

### Background Service Installer (Planned)
We're working on a **platform-agnostic background service installer** that will transform this development tool into a production-ready service. This will enable:

â€¢ **Automatic Startup** â€“ runs as a background service with system boot
â€¢ **Persistent Training** â€“ survives system restarts and continues training sessions
â€¢ **Service Management** â€“ easy install/uninstall with comprehensive monitoring
â€¢ **Cross-Platform** â€“ works seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux

See [BACKGROUND_SERVICE_ROADMAP.md](./BACKGROUND_SERVICE_ROADMAP.md) for the complete 5-phase development plan.

### Future Vision: Model Studio Tab
Our long-term vision includes a **graphical Model Studio** where users can:
â€¢ Visually design novel transformer architectures
â€¢ Experiment with different MoE configurations in real-time
â€¢ Test model performance instantly
â€¢ Save and share custom model designs

This will leverage our existing checkpoint system and WebSocket infrastructure to provide a powerful visual AI model development environment.

## Contributing
