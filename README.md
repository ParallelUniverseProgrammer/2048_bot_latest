  }
}
```

## 🏛️ System Architecture

The project is a decoupled, two-part system: a Python backend and a React frontend.

- **Backend**: A FastAPI server manages the entire training pipeline. It uses PyTorch for the neural network, Gymnasium for the game environment, and a custom PPO trainer. A `TrainingManager` runs the main loop in a separate thread, allowing for non-blocking control via REST and WebSocket endpoints. All operations are designed to be thread-safe.

- **Frontend**: A responsive React application built with Vite and TypeScript. It uses Zustand for efficient state management, Chart.js for visualizations, and Framer Motion for smooth animations. A sophisticated `WebSocket` utility handles real-time data streaming with adaptive timeouts, exponential backoff, circuit breaker patterns, and polling fallback to ensure a stable experience, especially on mobile networks. Enhanced loading states provide comprehensive progress tracking with step-by-step feedback and estimated completion times.

## 🤖 Neural Network Deep Dive

The core of this project is a purpose-built Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Transformer. This architecture was chosen over a standard transformer for its ability to develop specialized sub-networks (experts) that can handle distinct patterns and phases of the 2048 game, leading to more nuanced and effective decision-making.

Here's a breakdown of how the network processes the game state.

### 1. Input Processing: From Board to Language

The model doesn't "see" the board as pixels; it interprets it as a sequence of tokens, much like words in a sentence.

-   **Tokenization**: The 4x4 grid is flattened into a 16-token sequence. Each tile's value (e.g., 2, 4, 8, 1024) is transformed by taking its `log2` (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 10). This normalizes the values and creates a linear relationship that's easier for the network to learn. Empty tiles are represented by a zero token.
-   **2D Positional Encoding**: A standard transformer only knows the order of tokens, not their spatial relationship. For a grid game like 2048, knowing that one tile is "above" or "to the left of" another is critical. We inject this knowledge using a custom **2D positional encoding**, which encodes both row and column information for each of the 16 positions. This gives the model a native understanding of the board's geometry.

### 2. The Core: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Transformer

This is where the model's intelligence lies. Instead of a single, monolithic network processing every game state, the MoE architecture uses a collection of smaller, specialized networks.

-   **The Router**: At the heart of each MoE layer is a small "gating" network, or router. When a board state (represented as 16 tokens) arrives, the router analyzes it and decides which of the available "experts" are best suited to handle it. It's a "soft" decision—it assigns probabilities and routes the information to a small subset (e.g., the top 2) of the most relevant experts.

-   **The Experts**: Each expert is a standard feed-forward neural network. While they all start with the same architecture, training causes them to specialize. For example:
    -   *Expert 1* might become adept at identifying immediate merge opportunities in the early game.
    -   *Expert 4* could specialize in the complex patterns required to maintain an open board in the late game.
    -   *Expert 7* might learn to recognize defensive positions for survival when the board is cluttered.
    You can see this specialization emerge in real-time in the **Network Visualizer**.

-   **Load Balancing**: A key challenge with MoE is preventing the router from over-relying on a few "superstar" experts. To combat this, the training process includes an auxiliary **load-balancing loss**. This loss function penalizes the model if it doesn't spread the workload evenly, encouraging it to utilize all experts and fostering greater specialization.

### 3. Self-Attention: Discovering Relationships

Within each transformer block, the self-attention mechanism allows the model to weigh the importance of every tile relative to every other tile.

For each of the 16 positions, attention calculates a set of scores that determine how much "focus" to place on the other 15 positions. For example, a `512` tile in the corner might learn to pay high attention to an adjacent `512` tile (a merge opportunity) and to nearby empty cells (potential escape routes). This is the data visualized in the **Attention Heatmaps** tab, providing a direct look into the model's reasoning process.

### 4. Output Heads: The Final Decision

After the board state has been processed through multiple layers of attention and MoE blocks, the resulting high-level representation is passed to two final, separate networks:

1.  **Policy Head**: This head outputs a probability distribution over the four possible moves (Up, Down, Left, Right). It represents the model's final decision on which move is most likely to lead to a better outcome.
2.  **Value Head**: This head outputs a single scalar number, which is the model's assessment of the current board's quality. A high value signifies a strong, promising position, while a low value indicates a weak or dangerous one. This value is critical for the PPO algorithm to learn and improve its policy over time.
