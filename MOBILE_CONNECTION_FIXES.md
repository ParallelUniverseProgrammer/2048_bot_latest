# Mobile Connection Disconnection Fixes

## Problem Description

Mobile clients were experiencing random disconnections and inability to reconnect. This was caused by several issues:

1. **Aggressive Circuit Breaker**: Backend circuit breaker was too strict for mobile connections
2. **Race Conditions**: Multiple reconnection attempts conflicting with each other
3. **Short Timeouts**: Mobile connections had insufficient timeouts
4. **Poor Error Recovery**: Limited fallback mechanisms for mobile devices

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Backend WebSocket Manager Improvements

#### Circuit Breaker Adjustments
- **Mobile devices**: Increased failure threshold from 5 to 10 consecutive failures
- **Mobile devices**: Reduced circuit breaker duration from 30s to 15s
- **Slow send threshold**: Increased from 10 to 20 for mobile devices
- **Circuit breaker duration**: Reduced from 15s to 10s for slow sends on mobile

**File**: `backend/app/api/websocket_manager.py`
```python
# More lenient thresholds for mobile devices
failure_threshold = 10 if self.is_mobile else 5
circuit_duration = 15.0 if self.is_mobile else 30.0
slow_send_threshold = 20 if self.is_mobile else 10
```

#### Connection Health Tracking
- Added `is_mobile` field to `ConnectionHealth` class
- Mobile-specific health scoring and recovery

### 2. Frontend WebSocket Improvements

#### Enhanced Reconnection Logic
- **Mobile devices**: More aggressive backoff (1.5x base delay)
- **Early fallback**: Mobile devices switch to polling after fewer retry attempts
- **Longer timeouts**: Mobile Safari gets 8s timeout vs 5s for other mobile devices

**File**: `frontend/src/utils/websocket.ts`
```typescript
// More aggressive backoff for mobile devices
const baseDelay = isMobile() ? getConnectionRetryDelay() * 1.5 : getConnectionRetryDelay()

// Early fallback for mobile
if (isMobile() && reconnectAttempts >= Math.max(1, maxReconnectAttempts - 2)) {
  startPollingFallback()
}
```

#### Improved Error Handling
- Mobile-specific error messages
- Faster fallback to polling (500ms vs 1000ms)
- Better timeout handling for Mobile Safari

### 3. Mobile Detection Settings

#### More Lenient Retry Settings
- **Retry delay**: Reduced from 5000ms to 3000ms for Mobile Safari
- **Max attempts**: Increased from 3 to 5 for mobile devices
- **Base delay**: Reduced from 3000ms to 2000ms for other mobile devices

**File**: `frontend/src/utils/mobile-detection.ts`
```typescript
export const getConnectionRetryDelay = (): number => {
  return isMobileSafari() ? 3000 : 2000 // Reduced from 5000/3000
}

export const getMaxReconnectAttempts = (): number => {
  return isMobile() ? 5 : 10 // Increased from 3 for mobile
}
```

### 4. Enhanced Debugging

#### Mobile Debug Info Component
- Real-time connection status monitoring
- Connection history tracking
- Connection settings display
- Network quality detection

**File**: `frontend/src/components/MobileDebugInfo.tsx`

#### Mobile Connection Test Script
- Comprehensive mobile connection testing
- Multiple user agent simulation
- Connection recovery testing
- Backend endpoint validation

**File**: `tests/test_mobile_connection_issues.py`

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. Run the Mobile Connection Test

```bash
cd tests
python test_mobile_connection_issues.py
```

This will:
- Test WebSocket connections with various mobile user agents
- Test connection recovery after disconnections
- Validate backend endpoints
- Generate a detailed report

### 2. Manual Mobile Testing

1. **Start the backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Start the frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test on mobile device**:
   - Access the app from a mobile device
   - Monitor the Mobile Debug Info panel (visible on Mobile Safari)
   - Check connection history for stability
   - Test app switching (background/foreground)
   - Test network switching (WiFi to cellular)

### 3. Monitor Connection Health

The enhanced debug component shows:
- Real-time connection status
- Connection history with timestamps
- Current connection settings
- Network quality metrics
- Backend reachability status

## Expected Improvements

### Before Fixes
- Mobile clients disconnected frequently
- Reconnection attempts often failed
- Circuit breaker opened too aggressively
- Limited fallback mechanisms

### After Fixes
- More stable mobile connections
- Better reconnection success rates
- Graceful fallback to polling
- Mobile-specific optimizations
- Enhanced debugging capabilities

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Key Metrics to Watch
1. **Connection success rate**: Should be >90% for mobile
2. **Reconnection success rate**: Should be >80% for mobile
3. **Circuit breaker activations**: Should be minimal for mobile
4. **Polling fallback usage**: Should be <20% of mobile sessions

### Debug Information
- Check browser console for connection logs
- Monitor Mobile Debug Info panel
- Review connection history for patterns
- Test with different mobile devices and browsers

## Troubleshooting

### If Mobile Disconnections Persist

1. **Check network quality**:
   - Use the network quality detection in debug panel
   - Test with different network conditions

2. **Verify backend health**:
   - Run the mobile connection test script
   - Check backend logs for circuit breaker activations

3. **Test with different devices**:
   - Try different mobile browsers
   - Test on different mobile operating systems

4. **Review connection settings**:
   - Check if timeouts are appropriate for your network
   - Adjust retry settings if needed

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Mobile Safari specific issues**:
   - Longer timeouts are now applied
   - Enhanced error messages for debugging

2. **Network switching issues**:
   - Improved offline/online detection
   - Better visibility change handling

3. **App backgrounding**:
   - Enhanced visibility change detection
   - Automatic reconnection when app becomes visible

## Future Improvements

1. **Adaptive timeouts**: Based on network quality
2. **Connection pooling**: For multiple mobile connections
3. **Predictive reconnection**: Based on connection patterns
4. **Enhanced metrics**: More detailed connection analytics
