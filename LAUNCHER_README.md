## Technical Architecture

### **GUI Architecture**
```python
# Modern CustomTkinter-based GUI
class GUIWindow:
    def __init__(self, logger: Logger):
        # Configure for vibrant PC-forward appearance
        ctk.set_appearance_mode("dark")
        ctk.set_default_color_theme("blue")
        
        # Create compact main window
        self.window = ctk.CTk()
        self.window.title("2048 Bot Launcher")
        self.window.geometry("450x420")
        
        # Service management and status monitoring
        self._setup_service_controls()
```

### **Animation System**
```python
# Ultra-precise 60fps timing
frame_interval = 1.0 / 60.0  # 16.67ms
current_time = time.perf_counter()

# Smooth progress interpolation
easing_factor = 0.12  # Natural movement
progress_diff = self.target_progress - self.current_progress
self.current_progress += progress_diff * easing_factor
```

### **Non-Blocking Operations**
```python
# Background operations thread
background_thread = threading.Thread(target=self._run_background_operations)
background_thread.start()

# Main thread - always smooth 60fps
while self.background_operations['status'] != 'completed':
    self.console_ui.update_progress(step, progress)
    time.sleep(0.016)  # 60fps - NO BLOCKING
```

### **Double-Buffered Rendering**
```python
# Content change detection
current_content_hash = hash(f"{self.current_step}{self.current_progress:.3f}...")

# Cursor positioning instead of screen clearing
if not hasattr(self, '_first_render'):
    self.clear_screen()  # Only on first render
else:
    self.move_cursor(1, 1)  # Smooth updates
```

2. Install Python dependencies: `poetry install`
3. Install frontend dependencies: `cd frontend && npm install`
4. Run the launcher: `python launcher.py` or `python launcher.py --gui`

## GUI Mode Dependencies

The GUI mode automatically installs required dependencies:
- `customtkinter` - Modern GUI framework
- `pillow` - Image processing for icons and QR codes

**Note**: System tray integration (`pystray`) is implemented but may have compatibility issues on some platforms. The desktop window provides full functionality for service management and monitoring.
