# Network Architecture Specification

## Core Design Principles

### Sparsity-First Approach
- **Dynamic routing** based on input complexity and game stage
- **Load balancing** to prevent expert underutilization with auxiliary loss
- **Efficient computation** with minimal parameter usage and memory optimization
- **Scalable design** from small to large based on VRAM with dynamic configuration
- **Thread-safe operations** for concurrent training and WebSocket communication

## Model Architecture

### Input Representation
```python
# Board state encoding with 2D positional encoding
board_values = [2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536]
log2_values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]

# Input: 4x4 board → 16 tokens
# Each token: log2(value) + 2D_relative_position_embedding
# Empty cells: special token (value 0)
# 2D sinusoidal encoding for spatial relationships
```

### Advanced Position Encoding
```python
# 2D relative positional encoding with spatial relationships
# Each cell gets embedding based on its (row, col) position
# Relative distances between cells for attention mechanism
# 2D sinusoidal encoding for spatial relationships
# Adaptive encoding based on board complexity
```

### Advanced MoE Layer Design
```python
class DynamicMoELayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model, n_experts, min_experts=2, max_experts=8):
        # Dynamic expert selection based on input complexity and VRAM availability
        # Load balancing with auxiliary loss to ensure even expert utilization
        # Sparse routing with top-k selection (k varies by complexity)
        # Capacity factors to prevent expert overload
        # Thread-safe operations for concurrent training
        
    def forward(self, x, routing_weights=None):
        # Calculate input complexity score with board analysis
        # Select appropriate number of experts (2-8) based on resources
        # Route tokens to experts with load balancing and capacity limits
        # Combine expert outputs with weighted aggregation
        # Track expert usage for visualization and optimization
```

### Expert Specialization with Load Balancing
```python
class GameExpert(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model, d_ff):
        # General-purpose experts that learn specialization through training
        # Each expert can handle any game pattern with emergent specialization
        # Model learns to route based on input characteristics and complexity
        # No hard-coded specialization - emergent from training and load balancing
        # Performance tracking for efficiency optimization
```

### Advanced Multi-Head Attention
```python
class GameAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model, n_heads):
        # Standard multi-head attention with relative positional encoding
        # Attention weights for visualization with 4x4 grid display
        # Efficient implementation for 16-token sequences
        # Memory optimization for large models
        # Real-time attention pattern analysis
```

## Output Heads

### 1. Policy Head (Action Selection)
```python
class PolicyHead(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model):
        # Attention-based policy network with temperature scaling
        # Output: 4 action probabilities (up, down, left, right)
        # Softmax over actions with exploration parameters
        # Temperature scaling for exploration and exploitation balance
        # Real-time probability visualization for decision analysis
```

### 2. Value Head (State Evaluation)
```python
class ValueHead(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model):
        # Attention-based value estimation with confidence scoring
        # Output: scalar value for current state with uncertainty
        # Used for advantage calculation in PPO with bootstrapping
        # Value function regularization for stability
```

### 3. Advanced Auxiliary Heads
```python
class AuxiliaryHeads(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model):
        # Next tile prediction (2, 4 probabilities) with uncertainty
        # Board evaluation (win probability, game stage) with confidence
        # Merge opportunity detection with spatial analysis
        # Space utilization score with efficiency metrics
        # Training speed prediction for optimization
        # Performance analytics for model improvement
```

## Dynamic Sizing Strategy

### Advanced VRAM-Based Scaling
```python
class DynamicModelConfig:
    def __init__(self, available_vram_gb):
        # Small config (2-4GB): 4 layers, 4 experts, 256 dims with CPU fallback
        # Medium config (4-6GB): 6 layers, 6 experts, 384 dims with optimization
        # Large config (6-8GB): 8 layers, 8 experts, 512 dims with full features
        # Start small, scale up if VRAM available with memory monitoring
