### Ready for Week 1
The foundation is solid and ready for the next phase of implementation. The current implementation provides:

1. **Complete API Contract** - All endpoints working with proper validation
2. **Responsive UI Foundation** - Mobile-first design with proper styling
3. **Real-time Validation** - Both client and server-side validation working
4. **Code Generation** - Dynamic model creation and compilation
5. **Training Integration** - Seamless integration with existing PPO trainer

The Model Studio tab is now fully functional for the basic workflow: create design â†’ validate â†’ compile â†’ train, with a solid foundation for the upcoming drag-and-drop canvas implementation.
